## How do I make the app last longer?
## Are there any recommended settings?

Mainly, turn wifi off, turn mobile data off, turn background synchronization off, turn bluetooth off. 

If you turn mobile data off, you'll probably want to inject aGPS data regularly, there are apps that can do it for you. You can also try going into airplane mode which turns many things off. 

When it comes to choosing between *location sources* - GPS vs network - GPS will be more battery hungry, but has better accuracy; network location is easier on the battery but isn't as accurate.

For *time intervals*, consider using 60 seconds or more.
