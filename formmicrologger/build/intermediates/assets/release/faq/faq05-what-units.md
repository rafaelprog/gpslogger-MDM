## I am displaying imperial units but why isn't it logging imperial to the file?
## What are the units in which the values are logged?

When logging to file, the units are always in **SI units** - meters and seconds.

Any imperial units are only for display purposes and nothing else. The same applies for times and distances which may appear as *km/h* or *m/s* - these are purely for display.
