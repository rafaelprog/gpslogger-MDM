## What are profiles?

![profilesdemo](images/19profiles.gif)

Profiles are basically different settings, grouped under a name. For example you can have a *night* profile and a *trekking* profile with different logging frequencies, and switch between the two when you need to.

Tap the profile header and then "Add profile" to create a new profile. The new profile will have the same settings as the one you're currently on.  You can then modify a few settings and those should be specific to your new profile.

Conversely, any settings you change in one profile won't automatically be saved in other *existing* profiles.  It is recommended that you do your basic setup in the *Default Profile* first.  

You can delete a profile by long pressing it.
