## It's using the wrong timezone, can you make it use my timezone?

The standard when logging points is to use UTC. Since this is the standard, it would be wrong to use the the local time zone, the file is considered invalid. Instead, it is the responsibility of the software you use the log file on (Google Earth, GeoSetter, etc.) to adjust for your timezone. Any application that deals with GPX or KML files will have a setting that allows you to specify your own timezone.
