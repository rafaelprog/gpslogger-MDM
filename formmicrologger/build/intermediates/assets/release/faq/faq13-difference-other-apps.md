## How is this different from other logging apps?

It's meant to be more battery efficient. A lot of other apps, such as MyTracks, usually go with the assumption that you have a data connection available and your routes won't be very long. They use CPU wakelocks and log points extremely frequently with high accuracy. The aim of Formmicro is to log points and stay quiet.

To put it another way, MyTracks or similar are better suited for runs; Formmicro is suited for days out, hiking, photography.
